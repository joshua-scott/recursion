# recursion
A collection of ten C# 'mini-programs' mostly based around recursion, written for a Data Structures and Algorithms university course.

Due to their small size, the programs are all contained within one file, and perform the following tasks:
 1. Recursively print ints n to zero 
 2. Recursively print ints zero to n
 3. Iteratively calculate powers
 4. Recursively calculate powers
 5. Compare program 3 to program 4 to math.pow
 6. Recursively print a string in reverse
 7. Iteratively and recursively calculate sum of a list of numbers
 8. Iteratively convert an int to a string in decimal and binary
 9. Recursively solve towers of hanoi
10. Recursively print a pattern of ints
